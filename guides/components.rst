Flux Components

.. note::
    Flux is a Framework because we assemble several components together
    to manifest in the workload manager known as Flux. The slides below
    review some of the projects and terminology. If there is a component
    or abstraction that you don't see here (and would like to) please let
    us know by `opening an issue <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-docs/issues>`_
    on our issue board.
