=================

Welcome to the Command Tutorials! These tutorials should help you to map specific Flux commands
with your use case, and then see detailed usage.

 - ``flux mini submit/flux mini run`` (:ref:`flux-mini-submit`): "Submit a job in a Flux instance"
 - ``flux mini alloc/flux mini batch`` (:ref:`flux-mini-alloc`): "Create Flux subinstances"
 - ``flux proxy`` (:ref:`ssh-across-clusters`): "Send commands to a Flux instance across clusters using ssh"

This section is currently 🚧️ under construction 🚧️, so please come back later to see more command tutorials!
